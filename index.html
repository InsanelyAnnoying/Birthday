                       Happy Birthday Babyyyy! Today is your 19th birthday! We celebrate not just the day you were born, but also the incredible person you have become. Each year, you grow more amazing, and I am so grateful to have you by my side. I am very sorry this is all I can give you— for now. Even though this might not be enough, I hope this brings you as much joy and happiness as you have given to me since past few years.
                     </p>

                  <p>Today is also our 13th monthsary, and I can't help but reflect on all the beautiful moments we've shared. From our laughter-filled quality time to the quiet time we've spent together, every second with you is a treasure. You make even the simplest moments unforgettable, and I cherish every memory we've created together.</p>
